As part of the Intro to Machine Learning course we took during our 2nd year at Bar Ilan University, we were requested to implement a
Fully-Connected Neural Network in order to learn and predict labels of items in the "Fashion-MNIST" dataset (given to us in a pair of files to learn on, train_x (learning items) and train_y (learning labels) and a file (test_x) with items we had to output labels of (test_y, the file which is generated by our python code). The dataset consists of 28X28 single-value pixel images. There are 10 possible labels for each image, representing 10 diffetent fashion items.

After exploring different hyper-paramters (such as learning rate, number of epochs in the learning phase and the amount of hidden layers
and their size), we achieved a (k = 5, 80%(learning set)-20%(validation set)), cross validation verified, over 85& success rate.
The values we found giving this rate are:
learning rate = 0.01
one hidden layer sized 200
and 50 epcochs during the learning phase

A PDF report of our work is also included.
